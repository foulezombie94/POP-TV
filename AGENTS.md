## 0. Mission

Make an Android TV box look, feel and behave **exactly like Apple tvOS**. The owner judges every
change by one question: *would this pass as Apple-made?* Any of the following is an instant
rejection:

- Material Design components (`androidx.compose.material*`), ripples or elevation-heavy Android
  looks
- Generic "AI template" styling: navy gradients, coloured borders on every card, uniform cards
  with no hierarchy, decorative colour
- Invented data (fake numbers, placeholder content, "updated 2 min ago" that isn't true)
- Anything that lags on the target box

## 1. Non-negotiables

1. **The HIG is binding.** `docs/HIG-tvOS.md` holds the rules and numbers (safe area 80/60 pt,
   tvOS type scale, grid widths, tab bar 68 pt tall and 46 pt from the top, five focus states,
   parallax, Liquid Glass). **Units: dp = tvOS pt ÷ 2** (1920×1080 at 320 dpi).
2. **Use the design kit**, never raw values: `design/Tv.kt` (TvType, TvColors, TvDims, TvShapes,
   TvMotion), `design/LiquidGlass.kt`, `design/Components.kt`. For a new token, add it to the kit
   (or to the surface's own token object) with a comment saying why.
3. **Zero idle frames.** At rest the screen must render nothing. No `rememberInfiniteTransition`
   on always-visible UI, and no per-frame loops. Animate via `graphicsLayer` or the draw phase,
   with one-shot springs or tweens. Verify with gfxinfo (§5).
4. **Real data only.** TMDB, Open-Meteo, Apple's Aerial feed and the public Instagram profile.
   When data is missing, hide the element.
5. **Layout direction.** The box runs an Arabic (RTL) locale. tvOS surfaces are forced **LTR**
   (`CompositionLocalProvider(LocalLayoutDirection provides Ltr)`). The Arabic prayer dashboard
   is deliberately **RTL** and uses Arabic-Indic digits.
6. **Secrets.** The TMDB token lives only in `local.properties` → `BuildConfig.TMDB_READ_TOKEN`.
   Never commit it, never print it, never add other keys to source.

## 2. Stack & commands

- Kotlin 2.3, AGP 8.13, Compose BOM 2026.05, Media3 1.8, Coil 3, OkHttp 4. minSdk 26, targetSdk 34.
- JDK 21: `export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"`. Any other `java` on the PATH may be Java 8 and will break Gradle.
- Build + test: `./gradlew -q :app:testReleaseUnitTest :app:assembleRelease`
- **Install only the release APK** on the box. Debuggable Compose is too slow there.
- Parallel installs on one emulator: `-PidSuffix=.yourname` gives you a separate applicationId.

## 3. Architecture map

| Package | Owns | Key entry points |
|---|---|---|
| `design/` | Shared tvOS kit (do not fork it per screen) | `TvType`, `TvDims`, `LiquidGlass.liquidGlass()` |
| `ui/`, `home/`, `HomeViewModel.kt`, `MainActivity.kt` | Home launcher: tab bar, hero carousel, rows, Apps grid, focus | `HomeScreen`, `HomeViewModel.onDirection/onSelect`, `ContentRepository` |
| `search/` | Search app + product page | `SearchActivity` (extras `tmdb_id`, `tmdb_type` open a product page directly) |
| `settings/` | Settings app | `PagesDevice.kt` / `PagesLauncher.kt` build `PageSpec`s; `SettingsIcons.kt` draws the tiles |
| `system/` | Accessibility service in process `:system`: Home-key router, Control Center, App Switcher overlays | `SystemUiService`, `HomeKeyRouter` (600 ms hold / 350 ms double press) |
| `aerial/` | Aerial screensaver (`AerialDreamService`) | `AerialCatalogue`, `AerialPlayback`, `AerialNetwork` (Apple root CA, host-scoped) |
| `dashboard/` | Prayer-times screensaver over Aerial (`PrayerDashboardDream`) | `DashboardScreen`, `DashboardData` (weather + Instagram), `ArabicText` |
| `prayer/` | Offline prayer astronomy | `PrayerTimes.forDay`, `PrayerConfig.BaghdadJafari`, `PrayerSchedule` |
| `tmdb/` | TMDB v3 client | `trending`, `onProvider`, `search`, `details`, `logoPath`, `image()` |
| `prefs/` | `LauncherPrefs` (one process-wide `StateFlow`) | `LauncherPrefs.get(ctx).update { … }` |

Navigation on Home is a **pure state machine** in `HomeViewModel` + `home/HomeNav.kt`. Compose
focus is not used there. Keys arrive via `onPreviewKeyEvent` → `KeyRouter` → VM. Settings and
Search use Compose focus (`focusRequester`, `clickable`).

## 4. Design rules in practice

- **Focus = scale + lift + illumination** (white platter, black text, shadow). Never colour alone.
  On press, dip briefly (the HIG "highlighted" state).
- **Liquid Glass** (`liquidGlass()`) for navigation chrome, the tab bar, Control Center and idle
  buttons. Focused buttons turn white.
- **Grids**: 5-column app grid at 160×96 dp with 20 dp gaps and 40 dp side margins.
  Poster rows use the 7-column width. Leave room for the focus scale so a focused item never
  overlaps its neighbours.
- **Type**: SF Pro / SF Arabic through `TvType` (exact HIG sizes, weights and tracking). Large
  numerals use SemiBold/Bold. Secondary text is shown as white at lower opacity (78/58/40 %),
  never grey-on-grey.
- **Motion**: springs from `TvMotion`. Tab switch = fade out → fade in of pages that are already
  composed; the tab pill slides. Nothing loops at rest.
- Before any visual work, run the `anti-slop-design` process if your harness has it: fix a
  direction, freeze tokens, verify against screenshots.

## 5. Device workflow (the target box)

```bash
S=<adb serial or ip:5555>
adb -s $S install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# Reinstall unbinds the accessibility service — always re-enable:
adb -s $S shell 'settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.hamad.tvhome/com.hamad.tvhome.system.SystemUiService; settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1'
adb -s $S shell input keyevent KEYCODE_HOME
adb -s $S exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/shot.png      # then look at it
```

Performance check (required for any UI change):

```bash
adb -s $S shell 'dumpsys gfxinfo com.hamad.tvhome reset; sleep 5; dumpsys gfxinfo com.hamad.tvhome | grep -E "Total frames|Janky|90th|99th"'
# idle target: ~0 frames · navigation target: janky < 15 %, p90 ≤ 20 ms
```

Traps that look like bugs but aren't:

| Trap | What to do |
|---|---|
| `am force-stop com.hamad.tvhome` silently turns accessibility off | Re-enable it as above |
| Accessibility service enabled but `dumpsys accessibility` shows `services:{}` | A stale binding: `adb reboot` |
| `adb shell input keyevent` never reaches the Home-key router | Injected keys skip the a11y filter. Test long/double Home on the real remote, or with `uinput` on an emulator |
| Screenshots of the screensaver show black video | Hardware video plane; only the overlay is captured. Use an emulator to see video frames |
| Clock shows 2017 after a power loss | `settings put global ntp_server 162.159.200.123` |
| Shell `am start` can't open `SettingsActivity` / `SearchActivity` | They aren't exported. Open them through the Home tab bar (Search icon / gear) |

## 6. Multi-agent rules (learned the hard way)

- Work in isolated git worktrees; **each agent owns explicit files or packages** and edits nothing else.
- **Before merging any branch: `git diff --stat master <branch>`.** One agent once committed a
  stale worktree and silently reverted 38 files of other agents' work.
- Never uninstall, disable or remove packages on the owner's device unless explicitly asked.
- Only one agent drives the real box at a time; others use an emulator with `-PidSuffix`.
- Another live session may be editing the same repo. If files changed minutes ago, coordinate
  before you write.

## 7. Testing

- Unit tests live in `app/src/test/…` (JUnit 4). Any pure logic change needs tests: navigation,
  scrolling, formatting, astronomy, parsing.
- Prayer times are checked against Aladhan (`method=0`) to within 1 minute. If you change the
  angles or the city, update the reference values in `PrayerTimesTest`.
- UI is verified on the device by screenshot plus gfxinfo numbers, reported honestly in your summary.

## 8. Recipes

| Task | Where |
|---|---|
| Add a Home row | `home/ContentRepository.kt` (data) + `ui/Rows.kt` (render); keep HIG row widths |
| Add a Settings row/page | `settings/Pages*.kt` → return `Item`/`Header` in a `PageSpec`; only real, working actions |
| Change the prayer city/method | `prayer/PrayerTimes.kt` → new `PrayerConfig`; update tests |
| Change the Instagram account | `local.properties` → `INSTAGRAM_HANDLE=yourhandle` (blank = hidden) |
| New screensaver | Add a `DreamService` + manifest `<service>` with `BIND_DREAM_SERVICE` + an `xml/…_dream.xml` |
| New Control Center tile | `system/SystemControls.kt` (action) + `system/ControlCenter.kt` (tile); hide it if its intent doesn't resolve |

## 9. Commits & reporting

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `chore:`; one concern per commit.
- Your final report must be short and scannable: what changed, what you verified (numbers and
  screenshots), what is still broken. Never claim a check you didn't run.
